# graphql-sugar
Some helpers to make common patterns in graphql-go less boilerplatey.

This code began life at [Nav](https://www.nav.com/), where it was written by
Brent Tubbs, [Zach Abrahams](https://github.com/zachabrahams), [Tyson
Costello](https://github.com/so1ar), and [Craig
Jackson](https://github.com/tapocol).  Maybe some of this should be submitted
upstream.
